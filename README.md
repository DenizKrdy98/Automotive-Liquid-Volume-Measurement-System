# Automotive-Liquid-Volume-Measurement-System
Automative sytem to measure the urine volume in a urine bag for ICU patients, based on capacitive change.
The objective was to measure the urine volume in a urine bag for ICU patients.To achieve it, we tried to use diﬀerent methods. 

First of these was volume measurement using a camera. In this prototype, we measured the volume change by using colour detection which allows us to do simple urine analysis along with volume detection. After we ﬁnished this prototype the conditions of the ICU were not suited for this kind of setup , and camera was too expensive to implement it every types of bags. Therefore, we moved on to a diﬀerent approach.

Second method was measuring the volume by using ﬂow rate on the pipe. In this setup, we used 2 resistive sensors that can detect liquid presence. These sensors allows us to detect the ﬂow speed and ﬂow length of the passing liquid from a particular part of the urine pipe. By knowing the cross
sectional area of the pipe and the length between sensors, we should have been able to measure the volume of the passing liquid.
